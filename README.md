# Weapon Slot/Chooser
This addon allows the user to edit and save the slots of their weapons in realtime which also saves them locally so it always remembers even after restarts. Each row is scrollable and you can drag them between each of the rows/slots and then click "Make Changes" and it will save the layout. So far this works with all scripted weapons (Does not work with HL Weapons).

## How to use
Type in console "weapon_slots" this can also be added as a runcommand anywhere on your server to intergrate it.

## Change Log
### V2
- Weapons can now be disabled/hidden.
- HL2 weapons are now displayed but are not editable, due to limitations with [weapons.GetStored](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/weapons.GetStoreds) / [weapons.Get](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/weapons.Get)
